title: 'How can we get "lessons learned" from real cases?'
abstract: |
	This paper proposes an education course that will allow developers to gain the skills to become aware of problems, learn how to cope with them, and prevent recurring problems. Through the case study, the course will give generalized knowledge that we can use another kind of product or technology. The course will utilize case studies to teach learners the skills they need.
	
	We conducted an experimental course according to the plan mentioned below. We did a half day course in Nagoya, Japan, with 21 trainees. All of the trainees belongs to industries in the area. We identified that the proposed course works well. A few problems were identifed in the experimental course though, such as how to use the cases.
	
	The paper also includes one of the cases employed in our course. The case studies are based on the real problems in the industry.
